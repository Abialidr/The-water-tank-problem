# The water tank problem
The water tank problem is fixed with this repository. It offers two solutions to the issue.
The answers in solution one takes into account the fact that water can overflow if the centre wall is sandwiched between two absolute walls that are larger than that.  It is entirely accurate and always effective.

The result in solution two simply counts the units of water between two walls and ignores the possibility of overflowing. It is entirely accurate and always effective.
